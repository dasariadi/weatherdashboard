# weatherdashboard

This project is a simple project to create a webpage that displays the current weather condition for a city that I search in the search bar.

# Features of Application:

User can search city, and the current and future weather data is displayed on the screen. Last searched city will be stored in a storage, which allows users to obtain previously searched cities even after refreshing the page.
